definitions:
  nodes- smallest unit of computer hardware
         abstracts the hardware to ram and cpu capacity
  cluster- nodes that work together to form an abstracted machine
         eg. a cluster has two nodes with cpu of 1 and ram of 1, 
             therefore the cluster has cpu of 2 and ram of 2
           nodes pool resources in a cluster to do the work
  persistent volume - storage attached to the cluster (not to a particular node)
  containers - packaged programs
  pod - collection of one or more containers that shares the same resources and
        local network the unit of replication in kubernetes. to manage load,
        kubernetes can deploy a replica of the pod.
        **pods is the the unit of scale, therefore, 
  side-car - helper containers in a pod.
  deployment - management of one or more pods. basically declares how many replicas are
               made for each pod.
  ingress - open channel for communication into the cluster, and between pods. 
  Service - kubernetes resources that provide things like loadbalancing, etc.


tools:
  kubectl- command that interacts with the kubernetes api. create, update, delete
           resources (eg: pods, deployments, load balancers). **platform agnostic,
           though, so provisioning is handled elsewhere.
  minikube- provisions a one node cluster on a local machine.

questions:
  how does aws load balancing fit in? load balancing will be outside eks and within the kubernetes pod.
  how to add ingress channels? 
    is it possible through the config yaml?
